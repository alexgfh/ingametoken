[Token manager API](https://ingamecoin.xyz)​

Use it to easily implement cryptocurrency in your game!  
Though it's not yet audited for usage at commercial projects, this service is already perfectly suitable for test projects or even hobby projects!

For a sample game that uses this API, play [Cactus Land](https://alexgfh.itch.io/cactus-land​).  
With the withdrawn game coins, you can trade with others, potentially in Serum or any Exchange.
Or eventually, even send them across different games!

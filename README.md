Use [In Game Coin](https://ingamecoin.xyz) to easily implement cryptocurrency in your game!  
Though it's not yet audited for usage at commercial projects, this service is already perfectly suitable for test projects or even hobby projects!

For a sample game that uses this API, [Play Cactus Land](https://alexgfh.itch.io/cactus-land), or check the [Unity Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qqf67s5CdlfKebkjFo6DQotU9IqMFZWU/view).  
With the withdrawn game coins, you can trade with others, potentially in Serum or any Exchange or Automated Market Maker.  
Or eventually, even send them across different games!
